## Description

ðŸ“„ This project is an online image gallery that can be viewed by anyone. It also allows an authenticated user to login and rearrange the images in the gallery and also ease the user's search for some image in the gallery by implementing a search functionality with a tag name.

The interface was developed using React and Tailwind CSS, the user authentication was implemented using supabase while the drag&drop functionality was done with a react toolkit called dnd-kit.
